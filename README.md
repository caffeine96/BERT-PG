# BERT-PG
A Pointer Generator with a BERT encoder

## Data Source
As a toy set, we consider DUC2003 summarization dataset as train, DUC2004 summarization dataset as development and Gigaword data as prediction dataset.<br>
The train and dev dataset are pre-processed into text files with each line containing tab separated input and summaries.<br>
**Note:** For the model to run, preprocess your training data into this format.<br>
